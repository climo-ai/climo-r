# climo

The climo package is the R interface to the climo.ai platform. With the climo package, you can create, evaluate, share, and collaborate on clinical models directly from the R language. This package is the main driver for federated collaborations whereby multiple users can contribute data to fit a model without any user actually sharing data with the others. This package also allows you to evaluate other users' models on your own data, again without having to actually share any data.

The climo.ai platform follows the belief that individuals, labs, and companies can contribute a great deal to building better clinical prediction models by sharing models rather than entire datasets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of climo with the following statement:

``` r
devtools::install_github("climo-ai/climo-r")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(climo)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
